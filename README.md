Rule based System in Python

A rule-based system created for the “Capture the flag” competition in the course of “Games and Agents” (Utrecht University, 2013/2014). The game was based on a typical Capture the Flag match where two teams tries to win each other. 

We have implemented a rule-based system consists of four different commander's behavior: Defender, Balanced, Attacker and Greedy.  

The first rule-based system was created to fight the default team provided by the framework. 
Furthermore, we develop an upgraded version which is able to defeat our first rule-based system.
